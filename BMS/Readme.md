### Battery Management System

## Project Overview
In this project, I developed a Battery Management System (BMS) to efficiently manage a battery pack, utilizing MATLAB's Battery Builder application for designing the battery model. The BMS system includes a mode selection mechanism based on the State of Charge (SOC) value, which determines whether the battery is in charging or discharging mode using a Stateflow chart. The charging process incorporates Constant Current (CC) and Constant Voltage (CV) method. Additionally, the BMS ensures the safe operation of the battery by managing thermal conditions, monitoring the temperature, and adjusting current levels to prevent overheating during discharge.

1. Building the 3P4S Battery Pack:
- This configuration provides a total voltage of 16.8V.
- Note: For the purpose of a faster simulation, the battery pack is adjusted to 1.5Ah capacity and a 3.5V nominal voltage per cell with a 0.2 state of charge.
