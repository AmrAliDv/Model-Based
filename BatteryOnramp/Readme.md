### overview
This project utilizes MATLAB's Battery Designer application to model and simulate a battery pack with a 3P4S configuration.
The system implements thermal management through convection to ambient, and it estimates the State of Charge (SOC) using Coulomb Counting. 
Additionally, the charging current is dynamically adjusted based on temperature values to ensure safe and efficient charging.

### Features
- Battery Pack Configuration: The battery pack is modeled with a 3P4S configuration, which means 3 cells in parallel and 4 cells in series.
- Thermal Management: Convection-based thermal management is implemented to model heat dissipation to the surrounding environment.
- SOC Estimation: The Coulomb Counting method is used to estimate the battery's State of Charge (SOC).
- Dynamic Charging Control: The charging current is dynamically adjusted based on the battery temperature, preventing overheating during charging.
